TensorFlow, Keras and its components are the primary used libraries in this project. I have used CNN model for solving this problem of detecting pot-holed on the road. I have acquired pot-hole images from the kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/pradneshmhatre/pothole-detector-with-keras). In the code, I have used local path for the image datasets. That can be changed based on the location the dataset is stored. There are around 700 images which are split for test and train the model. I had to import Tensorflow, opencv supporting libraries.
